Text to Emotion Detector üé≠
============================

This project is an AI-based GUI application that detects the emotion from the input text using a Hugging Face Transformer model and displays a corresponding emoji. It also features a fun word-scramble game mode, history saving, and text-to-speech.

Repository: https://github.com/MuhammadTalhaCharan/text_to_emotion

------------------------
üìå Features
------------------------
- Detect emotions from text using Hugging Face transformer model.
- Shows appropriate emoji for the detected emotion.
- Fun Game Mode to unscramble emotion-related words.
- Save and view emotion detection history.
- Text-to-speech support (if pyttsx3 is installed).
- Clean and user-friendly GUI built with Tkinter.

------------------------
üß† How it Works
------------------------
1. User enters text in the GUI.
2. The Hugging Face model (`j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base`) predicts the dominant emotion.
3. The app displays a matching emoji and saves the text/emotion to a local JSON file.
4. Game Mode lets users unscramble emotion words for engagement.

------------------------

```
pip install sentencepiece
```

------------------------
üöÄ How to Run

üíæ Creating Executable (Windows)
------------------------
To create an `.exe` file for Windows:

1. Make sure `pyinstaller` is installed:
```
pip install pyinstaller
